<button>Hello</button>
<p>I am a single mother of 3. I am a financial advisor. I can make soap from scatch. I enjoy learning new things. I'm excited to learn web design. I have worked within the United States Postal Service for nine years. I was born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri. I moved to Texas in 2013 with my husband at the time, and our two sons, our third son came later. I have always worked and this field has been an exciting one for me. I am creative at heart so learning to build a website from scartch caught my attention. I am very grateful to have found Coding Temple. I will be able to learn the craft and do great things because of their team.</p>

<p>I do not know how to insert photos at this time. I will return once I get further in the course. In the end I want to learn everything about coding. I am having a lot of fun learning this new craft and I am only 35!</p>
